# Frog Jump Problem 🐸

## Problem Overview
A frog is positioned at point `X` on a one-dimensional number line and needs to reach or go beyond a destination at point `Y`. With every jump, the frog moves forward exactly `D` units (where `D` is a fixed positive integer). Determine the fewest jumps required for the frog to arrive at or surpass position `Y` from `X`.
## Constraints
X, Y, and D are positive integers in the range [1 .. 1 000 000 000]

It’s guaranteed that X ≤ Y 
## Example
Input: X = 10, Y = 85, D = 10

Process: The frog jumps to 40 (1st), then 70 (2nd), and finally 100 (3rd), which is ≥ 85.

Answer: 8 jumps
